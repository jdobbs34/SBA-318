## About
This an application allows users to view, create, read, update and delete recipes as well as filter recipes by category. I created 3 categories which were breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Each category is made up of the recipe name, ingredients used and recipe and instructiom on how to cook it. This is a single page interface using CRUD operations with middleware logging and handling errors.
